## About

Don't like the Twitter rebrand to x.com? Neither did I, so I made this Chrome extension that lets you r̶e̶v̶e̶r̶t̶ ̶x̶-̶b̶r̶a̶n̶d̶i̶n̶g̶ ̶b̶a̶c̶k̶ ̶t̶o̶ ̶t̶h̶e̶ ̶b̶e̶l̶o̶v̶e̶d̶ ̶b̶i̶r̶d̶ set the x branding to Jack Butcher's concept.

Shout out to Cygaar for creating the original "old twitter" extension.

The loading icon still needs to be replaced.
